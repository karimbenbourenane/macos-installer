# macos-installer

The personal macOS installer script of
[Karim Benbourenane](https://www.benbourenane.com). For both fun and profit. A
quick way to prepare a fresh machine to have all the tools of the trade as well
as personal artifacts, the way I like it.

## Usage

Paste the following commands into a macOS Terminal to run the installer.

```shell
BASE_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karimbenbourenane/macos-installer"
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL ${BASE_URI}/master/configurator)"
```

## What does it do?

The `configurator` script does some heavy lifting in setting up a new machine.
In order, it:

1. Installs the `chezmoi` dotfile manager
2. Initializes `chezmoi` using the dotfile repository of a named `github` user
    - The `dotfiles` repository is not public
3. Pulls down and stages all the latest dotfiles in that repository
    - Includes configuration for `Homebrew` brew bundles via `Brewfile`
    - Includes configuration for `vim-plug` vim plugin manager via `vimrc`
    - Includes configuration for several other things like ssh, git, and gpg
4. Creates folder structure for XDG Base Directory Specification
5. Installs the `Oh My Zsh` terminal framework for `zsh`
6. Installs the `Homebrew` package manager for `macOS`
7. Installs all `Homebrew` bundles in `Brewfile`
8. Installs local commonly used scripts
    - `configurator` - The script itself
    - `edit` - Use an environment-appropriate text editor
    - `git-multi` - Run git commands on multiple repositories at once
    - `update` - Keep everything installed by the `configurator` up to date
    - `pycharm` - Launch PyCharm using `open` instead of the included binary
9. Installs `vim-plug` and vim plugins in `vimrc`
10. Installs `GitHub Copilot` for command line

## Can I use this?

No. Well, maybe, but probably not.

If you're reading this, and you're not me, the `configurator` script may be of
little value to you. It requires access to a private `dotfiles` repository for
the user specified that I believe needs to be set up in the way `chezmoi`
expects. This project is opinionated with a heavy bias to myself, and I've set
it up so that I can quickly bootstrap a new machine (the way I like it) at a
moments notice by running a single command.

## Why is this public then?

Because I wanted to create the most brain-dead way of setting up a new
development machine, and preparing this script to be used at a moments notice
was the path of least resistance. It's accessible from the internet no matter
where I am in the world and I don't have to worry about misplacing my USB
drive. I didn't write this for you, I wrote it so I wouldn't forget how to run
this in the future.

## What if I still want to use it?

You may want to answer some questions first:

- Are you a developer that uses [`macOS`](https://www.apple.com/macos)?
- Are you a frequent user of [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh) for package
  management?
- Do you already use or plan to use [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io) for
  versioning your dotfiles?
- Do you like strictly adhering to the [`XDG Base Directory Specification`](
  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest) for config,
  data, runtime, and other directories?
- Are you a `vi`/`vim` minimalist that uses only [`vim-plug`](
  https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for managing your plugins?
- Do you use `brew-bundle` and keep your list of installed software tucked
  inside a [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)?
- Do you also happen to regularly use [`PyCharm`](
  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)?
- Is [`zsh`](https://www.zsh.org) your primary shell and do you want or need to
  use [`Oh My Zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh)?
- Do you want or need [`GitHub Copilot`](https://github.com/features/copilot)
  to be installed on your system?

If you answered "yes" to all of these questions, could you please email me or
leave a voicemail as a courtesy? I'd like to have enough time to find a good
hiding place before my doppelg√§nger comes to exterminate me.

Also, if you answered "yes", you can use this configurator the same way I
would, just by inputting your `GitHub` credentials when prompted. It will set
things up using your own personal `dotfiles` repository, which may or may not
result in complications I cannot anticipate. I offer no guarantee that the
`configurator` script works for you or results in a pleasant outcome for your
computing device, but you are welcome to use it or modify it as you see fit.
Absolutely no refunds will be given, even in cases of catastrophic failure.

## The `update` script

Once everything is installed, you're ready to go. The `update` script will be
in the `PATH` and can be executed to keep everything up to date in one
convenient shell command.
